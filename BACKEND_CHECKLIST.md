# Backend Development Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide the development of a robust, production-ready backend for your SocketChat application, ensuring all features are covered, integrated with the frontend, and ready for deployment. The stack includes Next.js (React TS), Supabase, Vercel, and Rust Solana SDK for blockchain features.

---

## 1. **Project Setup & Environment**
- [x] Ensure all environment variables are defined and documented (e.g., database URLs, API keys, secrets).
- [x] Set up `.env` files for local, staging, and production environments.
- [x] Configure TypeScript strict mode and linting for backend code.
- [x] Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and secure.
- [x] Add a `README.md` with backend setup and run instructions.

## 2. **API & Server Logic**
- [x] Implement RESTful/GraphQL API endpoints for all required features:
  - [x] User authentication (Supabase Auth or custom JWT/session logic).
  - [x] Real-time chat (Socket.io integration, as in `lib/socket-server.ts`).
  - [x] Message CRUD (send, edit, delete, fetch, reply, reactions, read receipts).
  - [x] Media upload, encryption, and retrieval (see `utils/media-encryption.ts`).
  - [x] Room management (create, join, leave, list rooms).
  - [x] User presence and typing indicators.
  - [x] Blockchain interactions (see below).
- [x] Ensure all API routes are protected and validate input.
- [x] Add rate limiting and abuse protection to sensitive endpoints.

## 3. **Socket.io & Real-Time Features**
- [x] Ensure Socket.io server is initialized only once (see `lib/socket-server.ts`).
- [x] Implement all event handlers:
  - [x] `join-room`, `send-message`, `edit-message`, `delete-message`, `message-reaction`, `message-read`, `user-typing`, `exchange-keys`.
  - [x] Broadcast events to relevant rooms/users only.
  - [x] Handle disconnections and reconnections gracefully.
- [x] Integrate encryption for messages and media (see `utils/encryption.ts`).
- [x] Test real-time flows with multiple clients.

## 4. **Database Integration (Supabase)**
- [x] Set up Supabase tables for users, rooms, messages, media, and reactions.
- [x] Use Supabase client/server SDK for all database operations.
- [x] Ensure all data is validated and sanitized before storage.
- [x] Implement database triggers/functions for notifications or analytics if needed.
- [x] Add indexes for performance on frequently queried fields.

## 5. **Blockchain Integration (Rust Solana SDK)**
- [x] Define which features require blockchain (e.g., message notarization, user identity, payments).
- [x] Write Rust Solana programs for required on-chain logic.
- [x] Expose blockchain interactions via API endpoints (using Next.js API routes or serverless functions).
- [x] Ensure secure key management and transaction signing.
- [x] Integrate with frontend for wallet connection and transaction flows.
- [x] Add tests for all blockchain logic.

## 6. **Security**
- [x] Use HTTPS everywhere (enforced by Vercel in production).
- [x] Sanitize all user input and escape output.
- [x] Implement authentication and authorization for all endpoints.
- [x] Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- [x] Rotate secrets and keys regularly.
- [x] Add logging and monitoring for suspicious activity.

## 7. **Testing**
- [x] Write unit and integration tests for all backend logic.
- [x] Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows (auth, chat, blockchain actions).
- [x] Use CI/CD to run tests on every push (GitHub Actions or Vercel).

## 8. **Deployment**
- [x] Ensure production build passes (`next build`).
- [ ] Push code to GitHub main branch.
- [ ] Set up Vercel project for automatic deployments from GitHub.
- [ ] Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard.
- [ ] Test production deployment for all features.
- [ ] Monitor logs and errors post-deployment.

## 9. **Documentation & Maintenance**
- [x] Document all API endpoints and events (OpenAPI/Swagger or markdown).
- [x] Add code comments for complex logic.
- [x] Maintain a changelog for backend updates.
- [x] Plan for regular dependency and security updates.

## 10. **Documentation & Optimization**
- [x] Create comprehensive API documentation in `docs/` directory.
- [x] Add deployment guides and environment setup documentation.
- [x] Document database schemas and relationships.
- [x] Create troubleshooting guides for common issues.
- [x] Add performance monitoring and optimization guides.
- [x] Document blockchain integration and smart contract interactions.
- [x] Create developer onboarding documentation.
- [x] Add automated documentation generation for API endpoints.

---

**Note:**
- All backend logic should be robustly connected to the frontend (React TS, Next.js) and tested in real-world scenarios.
- Blockchain features should be isolated and well-documented for maintainability.
- Use feature flags or environment checks to separate development and production logic.
